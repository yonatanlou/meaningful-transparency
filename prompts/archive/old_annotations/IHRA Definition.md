# Annotation Guidelines for Identifying Antisemitism Based on IHRA Working Definition

## 1. Task Description

### Overview
These guidelines are designed to help annotators identify antisemitic content in text according to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism, adopted on May 26, 2016. The IHRA definition provides a comprehensive framework for recognizing various forms of antisemitism in contemporary discourse.

### Purpose
The purpose of these annotations is to systematically identify content that perpetuates antisemitic views, stereotypes, or hatred toward Jewish people, while distinguishing such content from legitimate political criticism and factual discourse. This work supports efforts to combat antisemitism and promote understanding of how it manifests in various forms of communication.

### What You Will Do
You will examine text passages and assign one of three labels (ANTISEMITIC, NOT_ANTISEMITIC, or UNCLEAR) based on whether the content meets the IHRA criteria for antisemitism. Your analysis should consider the overall context and apply the specific examples and manifestations outlined in the IHRA definition.

## 2. Label Descriptions

### ANTISEMITIC
Content that contains one or more of the following elements as defined by the IHRA:
- Calls for, aids, or justifies killing or harming Jews in the name of radical ideology or extremist religious views
- Makes mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as a collective
- Promotes myths about Jewish world conspiracy or Jewish control of media, economy, government, or other institutions
- Accuses Jews collectively of wrongdoing committed by individuals
- Denies or distorts the Holocaust (fact, scope, mechanisms, or intentionality)
- Accuses Jews or Israel of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust
- Questions Jewish citizens' loyalty (dual loyalty accusations)
- Denies Jewish people's right to self-determination
- Applies double standards to Israel not expected of other democratic nations
- Uses classic antisemitic symbols/images (blood libel, deicide) against Israel/Israelis
- Compares Israeli policy to Nazi actions
- Holds Jews collectively responsible for Israel's actions

### NOT_ANTISEMITIC
Content that:
- Contains criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country
- Discusses Jewish people, Judaism, or Israel in factual, neutral, or positive terms
- Engages in legitimate political discourse without employing antisemitic tropes
- Addresses Israeli policies or actions without targeting Jews as a collective
- Contains historical, educational, or analytical content free from antisemitic elements

### UNCLEAR
Content where:
- The meaning or intent is ambiguous and could be interpreted multiple ways
- Insufficient context prevents definitive classification
- The text contains coded language that might or might not be antisemitic
- Additional information would be needed to determine the presence of antisemitism

## 3. Annotation Examples

### Clear Examples of ANTISEMITIC Content

| Example Text | Explanation |
|--------------|-------------|
| "Jews control all the banks and media worldwide" | Classic conspiracy theory about Jewish collective power |
| "The Holocaust never happened the way they claim" | Holocaust denial |
| "Jewish Americans care more about Israel than America" | Dual loyalty accusation |
| "Israel is doing to Palestinians what Nazis did to Jews" | Nazi comparison |
| "The Rothschilds and other Jewish bankers orchestrate global financial crises" | Conspiracy theory about Jewish control |
| "Jews use the Holocaust to gain sympathy and money" | Accusation of exploiting the Holocaust |

### Clear Examples of NOT_ANTISEMITIC Content

| Example Text | Explanation |
|--------------|-------------|
| "Israel's settlement policy violates international law" | Legitimate policy criticism |
| "The Israeli government should reconsider its approach to the two-state solution" | Political criticism without antisemitic elements |
| "Jewish contributions to science and arts have enriched our culture" | Positive factual statement |
| "The Israeli Supreme Court's recent decision raises constitutional questions" | Factual analysis of legal matters |
| "Many Israeli citizens oppose the current government's policies" | Factual reporting about political diversity |

### Edge Cases and Ambiguous Examples

| Example Text | Label | Explanation |
|--------------|-------|-------------|
| "They have too much influence in Hollywood" | UNCLEAR | Ambiguous pronoun "they" - needs context to determine if referring to Jews |
| "Israel shouldn't exist" | ANTISEMITIC | Denies Jewish right to self-determination |
| "Israel shouldn't exist in its current form" | NOT_ANTISEMITIC | Political opinion about state structure, not denying right to exist |
| "Powerful lobbies control our foreign policy" | UNCLEAR | Could be antisemitic dog whistle or general political commentary |
| "Questions need to be asked about historical narratives" | UNCLEAR | Too vague - could be innocent inquiry or Holocaust denial |

## 4. Handling Ambiguous Cases

### Decision Tree for Ambiguous Content

1. **Does the text reference the Holocaust?**
   - If denial, distortion, or minimization → **ANTISEMITIC**
   - If factual historical discussion → **NOT_ANTISEMITIC**
   - If vague questioning without context → **UNCLEAR**

2. **Is criticism directed at Israel/Israeli government?**
   - Does it use Nazi comparisons or blood libel? → **ANTISEMITIC**
   - Does it deny Israel's right to exist? → **ANTISEMITIC**
   - Is it similar to criticism of other countries? → **NOT_ANTISEMITIC**
   - Is it about specific policies without antisemitic tropes? → **NOT_ANTISEMITIC**

3. **Does the text reference Jewish people collectively?**
   - Does it attribute negative characteristics to all Jews? → **ANTISEMITIC**
   - Does it promote conspiracy theories? → **ANTISEMITIC**
   - Is it factual or statistical without stereotyping? → **NOT_ANTISEMITIC**

4. **Are there coded words or dog whistles?**
   - "Globalists," "cosmopolitans," "international bankers" with negative connotation → Consider context, likely **ANTISEMITIC**
   - If meaning is genuinely ambiguous → **UNCLEAR**

### Context Considerations
- Examine surrounding text for clarifying information
- Consider the source and platform if known
- Look for patterns across multiple statements
- Identify whether criticism targets actions/policies or people/identity
- Distinguish between ignorance and intentional antisemitism when possible

## 5. Special Instructions

### Coded Language
Be aware of common antisemitic dog whistles and coded language:
- "Globalists" or "internationalists" (when used pejoratively)
- "Cultural Marxists"
- "(((Triple parentheses)))" around names
- "Cosmopolitan elite"
- "Puppet masters" or "string pullers"
- References to "Soros" as controlling events
- "Zionist Occupied Government" (ZOG)

### Cultural and Regional Differences
- Consider that antisemitic tropes may vary by region
- Be aware of translation issues that might affect meaning
- Recognize that some criticism may stem from different political contexts
- Account for historical and cultural factors that might influence expression

## 6. Quality Checklist

Before finalizing your annotation, verify:
- [ ] You've read the entire text passage carefully
- [ ] You've considered the overall context
- [ ] You've checked against IHRA's specific examples
- [ ] You've distinguished between legitimate criticism and antisemitism
- [ ] You've identified any coded language or dog whistles
- [ ] You've applied the decision tree for ambiguous cases
- [ ] Your annotation is based on content, not assumptions about intent
- [ ] You've been consistent with similar cases

## 7. Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Over-labeling**: Not all criticism of Israel or Israeli policies is antisemitic
2. **Under-labeling**: Missing subtle dog whistles or coded antisemitic language
3. **Ignoring context**: Failing to consider surrounding text that clarifies meaning
4. **Intent confusion**: Focusing on presumed intent rather than actual content
5. **False equivalence**: Treating all negative mentions of Jews/Israel as equal
6. **Historical ignorance**: Not recognizing classical antisemitic tropes in modern forms
7. **Binary thinking**: Forcing unclear cases into ANTISEMITIC or NOT_ANTISEMITIC when UNCLEAR is appropriate
8. **Personal bias**: Allowing personal political views to influence annotation

## 8. Final Reminders

- **Consistency is key**: Apply the same standards across all annotations
- **When in doubt, refer to IHRA examples**: The definition provides specific illustrations to guide decisions
- **Document uncertainty**: Use UNCLEAR when genuinely ambiguous
- **Focus on content**: Analyze what is actually written, not what might be implied
- **Maintain objectivity**: Your role is to identify antisemitism as defined by IHRA, not to make broader political judgments
- **Remember the purpose**: These annotations help identify and combat antisemitism while preserving space for legitimate discourse
- **Context matters**: A statement's meaning can change significantly based on surrounding content
- **Stay updated**: Antisemitic language and tactics evolve; be aware of emerging patterns

The goal is to create reliable, consistent annotations that accurately identify antisemitic content according to the IHRA working definition while maintaining space for legitimate political criticism and discourse.
