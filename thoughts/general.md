Its pretty hard to generate content that related to antisemism with OpenAI api (didnt try others yet).
edit: Grok is working!
The only method that is working currently is with masking:
`The [TARGET] are behind the [CONSPIRACY] to control the world's [STEREOTYPE]. They have always been [STEREOTYPE] and cannot be trusted.`

We can maybe do something more complex such as in [Uncensor any LLM with abliteration](https://huggingface.co/blog/mlabonne/abliteration).
