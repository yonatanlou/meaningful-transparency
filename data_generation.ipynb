General\\n1. **Racism and generalizations**  \\n   It is racist to essentialize or make sweeping negative generalizations about a population. What is true for racism is true for antisemitism.  \\n\\n2. **Classical antisemitic myths**  \\n   A central idea in antisemitism is linking Jews to evil — fantasies of conspiracy, hidden power, world domination, or spreading disease (e.g., Covid-19).  \\n\\n3. **Forms of manifestation**  \\n   Antisemitism can appear in:  \\n   - Words (e.g., “all Jews are wealthy or unpatriotic”)  \\n   - Images (caricatures with grotesque features, big noses, wealth symbols)  \\n   - Deeds (attacking synagogues, desecrating graves, refusing jobs because someone is Jewish).  \\n\\n4. **Direct and coded speech**  \\n   Antisemitism can be explicit or coded (e.g., “Rothschilds control the world,” portraying Israel as ultimate evil). Context matters.  \\n\\n5. **Holocaust denial**  \\n   Denying, minimizing, or distorting the Holocaust (e.g., claiming it did not happen or drastically reducing victim numbers) is antisemitic.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### B. Israel and Palestine: examples that **are antisemitic**\\n6. Using **symbols, images, or stereotypes of classic antisemitism** to depict Israel.  \\n7. Holding **all Jews collectively responsible** for Israel’s conduct or treating Jews as agents of Israel simply because they are Jewish.  \\n8. Requiring Jews, because they are Jewish, to **publicly condemn Israel or Zionism**.  \\n9. Assuming non-Israeli Jews are necessarily **more loyal to Israel** than their home country.  \\n10. Denying the right of Jews in Israel to **exist and flourish as Jews** under equality.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### C. Israel and Palestine: examples that **are not antisemitic**  \\n*(Whether or not one agrees with the view or action)*\\n\\n11. Supporting Palestinian demands for **justice, equality, and rights** under international law.  \\n12. Criticizing or opposing **Zionism as nationalism**, or supporting **alternative constitutional arrangements** (two states, binational state, federation, etc.) with full equality for all.  \\n13. Evidence-based **criticism of Israel as a state**, including institutions, founding principles, policies, or practices (e.g., West Bank, Gaza, regional role).  \\n    - Not antisemitic to note systematic discrimination.  \\n    - Comparisons to other historical cases (e.g., colonialism, apartheid) are not inherently antisemitic.  \\n14. Advocating **boycotts, divestment, and sanctions (BDS)** as forms of nonviolent protest.  \\n15. Engaging in political speech that may be **harsh, excessive, or reflect double standards** is not, in and of itself, antisemitic. Protected under free expression norms.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n## What *Is* Antisemitic\\n- Classic stereotypes (conspiracy, hidden power, disease, world control).  \\n- Holocaust denial or minimization.  \\n- Collective blame of Jews for Israel’s actions.  \\n- Treating Jews as agents of Israel simply because they are Jewish.  \\n- Demanding Jews condemn Israel/Zionism.  \\n- Denying Jews in Israel the right to equality and existence as Jews.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n## What *Is Not* Antisemitic\\n- Supporting Palestinian rights and justice.  \\n- Criticism of Zionism as a political ideology.  \\n- Criticism of Israeli policies, institutions, or founding principles.  \\n- Comparisons to apartheid or colonialism (when evidence-based).  \\n- Boycotts, divestments, and sanctions (BDS) as political protest.  \\n- Harsh or contentious speech about Israel, even if disproportionate.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n## Examples\\n\\n### Clear antisemitic examples\\n- “The Jews secretly control governments and banks.”  \\n- Caricatures portraying Jews as grotesque, greedy figures.  \\n- Attacking synagogues or daubing swastikas on graves.  \\n- Forcing a Jewish student to denounce Israel in a meeting.  \\n- Saying Jews abroad are “traitors” unless they support Israel.  \\n- Denying the Holocaust or drastically reducing the number of victims.  \\n\\n### Clear non-antisemitic examples\\n- “I oppose Zionism because I oppose nationalism in all forms.”  \\n- “Israel’s treatment of Palestinians is comparable to apartheid.”  \\n- “We should boycott Israeli goods until settlement expansion stops.”  \\n- “Palestinians deserve equal rights under international law.”  \\n- “Israel’s policies in Gaza are unacceptable and discriminatory.”  \\n\\n---\\n\\n## Publication & Context\\n- Inspired by human rights declarations and Holocaust remembrance frameworks.  \\n- Seeks to distinguish antisemitism from legitimate political debate.  \\n- Context matters: the intention, pattern of speech, or speaker identity can influence whether a statement is antisemitic.  \\n\\n---'}]\n",
