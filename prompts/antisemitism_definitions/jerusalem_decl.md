# Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA)

## Preamble
The Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) is the work of international scholars in Antisemitism Studies, Jewish, Holocaust, Israel, Palestine, and Middle East Studies.  
It responds to the **IHRA Definition** (2016), which has been criticized as unclear and controversial.  
The JDA aims to provide:  
- A **clearer core definition** of antisemitism  
- A **coherent set of guidelines** to assist in monitoring, combating, and educating about antisemitism  

The declaration is **non-legally binding** but is intended as an alternative or interpretive tool for institutions that use the IHRA Definition.  
It seeks to clarify **legitimate vs illegitimate political speech** about Israel, Zionism, and Palestine while preserving open debate.

## Core Definition
**Antisemitism is discrimination, prejudice, hostility or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish).**

---

## Guidelines

### A. General
1. **Racism and generalizations**  
   It is racist to essentialize or make sweeping negative generalizations about a population. What is true for racism is true for antisemitism.  

2. **Classical antisemitic myths**  
   A central idea in antisemitism is linking Jews to evil — fantasies of conspiracy, hidden power, world domination, or spreading disease (e.g., Covid-19).  

3. **Forms of manifestation**  
   Antisemitism can appear in:  
   - Words (e.g., “all Jews are wealthy or unpatriotic”)  
   - Images (caricatures with grotesque features, big noses, wealth symbols)  
   - Deeds (attacking synagogues, desecrating graves, refusing jobs because someone is Jewish).  

4. **Direct and coded speech**  
   Antisemitism can be explicit or coded (e.g., “Rothschilds control the world,” portraying Israel as ultimate evil). Context matters.  

5. **Holocaust denial**  
   Denying, minimizing, or distorting the Holocaust (e.g., claiming it did not happen or drastically reducing victim numbers) is antisemitic.

### B. Israel and Palestine: examples that **are antisemitic**
6. Using **symbols, images, or stereotypes of classic antisemitism** to depict Israel.  
7. Holding **all Jews collectively responsible** for Israel’s conduct or treating Jews as agents of Israel simply because they are Jewish.  
8. Requiring Jews, because they are Jewish, to **publicly condemn Israel or Zionism**.  
9. Assuming non-Israeli Jews are necessarily **more loyal to Israel** than their home country.  
10. Denying the right of Jews in Israel to **exist and flourish as Jews** under equality.  

---

### C. Israel and Palestine: examples that **are not antisemitic**  
*(Whether or not one agrees with the view or action)*

11. Supporting Palestinian demands for **justice, equality, and rights** under international law.  
12. Criticizing or opposing **Zionism as nationalism**, or supporting **alternative constitutional arrangements** (two states, binational state, federation, etc.) with full equality for all.  
13. Evidence-based **criticism of Israel as a state**, including institutions, founding principles, policies, or practices (e.g., West Bank, Gaza, regional role).  
    - Not antisemitic to note systematic discrimination.  
    - Comparisons to other historical cases (e.g., colonialism, apartheid) are not inherently antisemitic.  
14. Advocating **boycotts, divestment, and sanctions (BDS)** as forms of nonviolent protest.  
15. Engaging in political speech that may be **harsh, excessive, or reflect double standards** is not, in and of itself, antisemitic. Protected under free expression norms.

## What *Is* Antisemitic
- Classic stereotypes (conspiracy, hidden power, disease, world control).  
- Holocaust denial or minimization.  
- Collective blame of Jews for Israel’s actions.  
- Treating Jews as agents of Israel simply because they are Jewish.  
- Demanding Jews condemn Israel/Zionism.  
- Denying Jews in Israel the right to equality and existence as Jews.  

---

## What *Is Not* Antisemitic
- Supporting Palestinian rights and justice.  
- Criticism of Zionism as a political ideology.  
- Criticism of Israeli policies, institutions, or founding principles.  
- Comparisons to apartheid or colonialism (when evidence-based).  
- Boycotts, divestments, and sanctions (BDS) as political protest.  
- Harsh or contentious speech about Israel, even if disproportionate.  

---

## Examples

### Clear antisemitic examples
- “The Jews secretly control governments and banks.”  
- Caricatures portraying Jews as grotesque, greedy figures.  
- Attacking synagogues or daubing swastikas on graves.  
- Forcing a Jewish student to denounce Israel in a meeting.  
- Saying Jews abroad are “traitors” unless they support Israel.  
- Denying the Holocaust or drastically reducing the number of victims.  

### Clear non-antisemitic examples
- “I oppose Zionism because I oppose nationalism in all forms.”  
- “Israel’s treatment of Palestinians is comparable to apartheid.”  
- “We should boycott Israeli goods until settlement expansion stops.”  
- “Palestinians deserve equal rights under international law.”  
- “Israel’s policies in Gaza are unacceptable and discriminatory.”  

---

## Publication & Context
- Inspired by human rights declarations and Holocaust remembrance frameworks.  
- Seeks to distinguish antisemitism from legitimate political debate.  
- Context matters: the intention, pattern of speech, or speaker identity can influence whether a statement is antisemitic.
