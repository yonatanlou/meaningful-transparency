## Definition of antisemitism
Antisemitism consists of **anti-Jewish attitudes, actions, or systemic conditions** that include:
- Negative beliefs and feelings about Jews  
- Hostile behavior directed against Jews  
- Conditions that **discriminate** against Jews and **impede equal participation** in political, religious, cultural, economic, or social life  

At its core is **persistent demonization** that casts Jews as “others,” threatening, powerful, secretive, manipulative, untrustworthy, controlling, and responsible for others’ suffering.

Understanding and addressing antisemitism is important in its own right and is part of the broader struggle against all oppression.

Antisemitic behaviors can emerge from **indifference or stereotyping** and can occur **even without explicit prejudicial attitudes**. They can also coexist with **positive attitudes toward some Jews or institutions**.

Antisemitism appears in different forms across social, political, cultural, religious, and historical contexts and can target Jews of all races, denominations, gender identities, levels of observance, and political ideologies.

Antisemitism fulfills a **social function** for some people by explaining social disorders and fueling oppression of minorities while fomenting division between Jews and other minorities.

## Why Israel is often involved in the discussion
As a realization of collective Jewish organization and action, **Israel is a magnet for and target of antisemitic behavior**, so it is important to specify what is and is not antisemitic in relation to Israel.

---

## Israel and Zionism: key points
- **Israel** has the **rights and responsibilities** of other sovereign states and is subject to praise, condemnation, support, and opposition based on its relationships and obligations.  
- **Zionism** affirms the right of the Jewish people to **self-determination** in their ancestral homeland. The term has multiple meanings and should be used precisely. There are many varieties of Zionism.  
- Zionism **does not** imply approval of any particular Israeli government policy. Calling someone “anti-Zionist” is not appropriate merely because they oppose specific Israeli policies.

---

## Opposition to Zionism and/or Israel: when it is **not** antisemitic
People may oppose Zionism and/or Israel **for multiple reasons** that are **not inherently antisemitic**, including:
- Opposition to nationalism or ethnonationalism in general  
- Personal or national experiences adversely affected by the creation of the State of Israel, such as Palestinian experiences of inequality or exile  
- Ethical or religious convictions, including those held by some Jews, that oppose a Jewish state  

None of these motivations necessarily constitute antisemitic behavior.

## Criticism of Israel and Zionism: what is **not** antisemitic
- **Criticism of Zionism or Israel, opposition to policies, or nonviolent political action** directed at the State of Israel should **not, as such, be deemed antisemitic**.  
- Using accusations of antisemitism to **suppress criticism** of Israel is dangerous. It distracts from bona fide antisemitism, harms free expression, and undermines constructive debate.  
- **Even contentious or harsh criticism** of Israel, including criticism of historical actions tied to Israel’s creation, is **not per se antisemitic**. This includes critiques of **forms of Zionism incompatible with equal dignity or self-determination of others**.  
- **Judging Israel by the same standards** applied to other countries is **not** antisemitism. Paying disproportionate attention to Israel is **not automatic evidence** of antisemitism when there are neutral reasons, such as Israel’s level of military aid or religious connections. **Singling out Israel because it is a Jewish state** and applying **different standards** is antisemitic.

---

## When criticism or opposition **is** antisemitic
Speech or conduct about Zionism and Israel should be judged by the **same standards** as antisemitism generally. It is antisemitic to promote **myths, stereotypes, or tropes** about Zionism or Israel that derive from and reinforce antisemitic accusations. These include:  
- Portraying Israel as part of a **sinister world conspiracy** of Jewish control over media, economy, government, or other institutions.  
- **Indiscriminately blaming** global suffering or injustices on a **Jewish conspiracy** or the malign hand of Israel or Zionism.  
- **Holding individuals or institutions culpable because they are Jewish** for real or imagined wrongdoing by Israel.  
- Claiming Jews are **incapable of setting aside affinity or loyalty** to the Jewish people or Israel.  
- **Denigrating or denying** the Jewish identity of Jews perceived as holding the “wrong” position on Israel.  

**Other cases** that may be antisemitic include:  
- Using symbols or images that present **Jews worldwide as collectively guilty** for actions of the State of Israel.  
- **Attacking a Jew** because of their relationship to Israel.  
- Conveying **intense hostility** toward Jews connected to Israel in ways that intentionally or irresponsibly risk **provoking antisemitic violence**.  
- Treating Israel negatively based on a claim that **Jews as a people should be denied self-definition and self-determination**.  
- Advocating a political solution that **denies Jews**, because they are Jews, the **right to self-determination, physical safety, and full human, civil, and religious rights**.  

**Bottom line criterion:** It is antisemitic when speech or conduct is **harmful, hostile, degrading, or discriminatory** toward Jews, in word or action, such that it **significantly impedes** their equal participation in political, religious, cultural, economic, or social life.
