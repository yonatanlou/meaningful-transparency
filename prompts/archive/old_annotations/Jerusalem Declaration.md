# Annotation Guidelines for Identifying Antisemitism Based on the Jerusalem Declaration

## 1. Task Description

### Overview
These guidelines are designed to help annotators identify antisemitic content based on the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA). The JDA provides a clear, concise, and historically-informed definition that aims to strengthen the fight against antisemitism while protecting space for legitimate political discourse, particularly regarding Israel and Palestine.

### Purpose
The purpose of these annotations is to accurately identify content that constitutes discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews, while distinguishing this from legitimate criticism of states, policies, or political ideologies. These guidelines will help create consistent, nuanced assessments that recognize both the serious nature of antisemitism and the importance of protecting free political speech.

### What You Will Do
You will examine text passages and determine whether they contain antisemitic content according to the JDA definition. This involves identifying classical antisemitic tropes, recognizing coded language, understanding context, and distinguishing between antisemitism and legitimate political criticism, particularly regarding Israel-Palestine issues.

## 2. Label Descriptions

### **ANTISEMITIC**
Content that demonstrates discrimination, prejudice, hostility, or violence against Jews as Jews (or Jewish institutions as Jewish). This includes:
- Essentializing Jews or making sweeping negative generalizations
- Linking Jews to forces of evil or conspiracy theories
- Using classical antisemitic imagery or stereotypes
- Denying or minimizing the Holocaust
- Applying antisemitic symbols to Israel
- Holding Jews collectively responsible for Israel's actions
- Requiring Jews to condemn Israel/Zionism because they are Jewish
- Assuming dual loyalty of non-Israeli Jews
- Denying Jews' right to exist and flourish in Israel

### **NOT_ANTISEMITIC**
Content that includes:
- Support for Palestinian rights and justice according to international law
- Criticism of Zionism as a form of nationalism
- Evidence-based criticism of Israeli state policies and practices
- Advocacy for various constitutional arrangements (one-state, two-state, etc.)
- Comparisons of Israel to other historical cases when evidence-based
- Boycott, divestment, and sanctions as forms of political protest
- Political speech that may be excessive or reflect double standards but doesn't invoke antisemitic tropes

### **UNCLEAR**
Content where:
- The speaker's intent is ambiguous
- Coded language could have multiple interpretations
- Context is insufficient to determine if antisemitic tropes are being invoked
- The identity of the speaker and broader context would significantly impact interpretation

## 3. Annotation Examples

### Clear Examples of ANTISEMITIC Content
| Example Text | Reasoning |
|--------------|-----------|
| "The Rothschilds control the world's banks" | Classic conspiracy theory linking Jews to hidden financial power |
| "Jews were behind COVID-19 to profit from vaccines" | Links Jews to spreading disease and evil conspiracies |
| "The Holocaust numbers have been greatly inflated" | Holocaust minimization |
| "All American Jews are more loyal to Israel than the US" | Dual loyalty accusation |
| "Jewish money controls our government" | Conspiracy theory about hidden Jewish power |
| "Israel is poisoning Palestinian wells, just like medieval Jews" | Applying blood libel to Israel |

### Clear Examples of NOT_ANTISEMITIC Content
| Example Text | Reasoning |
|--------------|-----------|
| "Israel's settlement policy violates the Fourth Geneva Convention" | Evidence-based criticism of state policy |
| "Palestinians deserve full civil and political rights" | Supporting human rights |
| "BDS is a legitimate form of non-violent protest" | Political protest method |
| "Israel practices apartheid in the West Bank" | Evidence-based comparison with citation |
| "Zionism as implemented has displaced Palestinians" | Historical criticism of political movement |
| "A binational state with equal rights for all is the best solution" | Political position on state arrangements |

### Edge Cases and Ambiguous Examples
| Example Text | Label | Reasoning |
|--------------|-------|-----------|
| "They control too much" | UNCLEAR | Without context, "they" is ambiguous |
| "Israel acts like a Nazi state" | ANTISEMITIC/UNCLEAR | Depends on context - if systematic comparison with evidence vs. inflammatory rhetoric |
| "Zionist lobby has too much influence" | UNCLEAR | Could be legitimate political criticism or coded antisemitism depending on context |
| "Questions need to be asked about historical events" | UNCLEAR | Could be innocent inquiry or Holocaust denial |

## 4. Handling Ambiguous Cases

### Decision Tree for Ambiguous Content

1. **Does the text reference Jews as a collective?**
   - Contains conspiracy theories or evil linkage → **ANTISEMITIC**
   - Makes factual or positive statements → **NOT_ANTISEMITIC**
   - Ambiguous generalization → Check for essentializing

2. **Is Israel or Zionism criticized?**
   - Uses evidence-based arguments → **NOT_ANTISEMITIC**
   - Applies classical antisemitic tropes → **ANTISEMITIC**
   - Compares to other states/movements fairly → **NOT_ANTISEMITIC**
   - Singles out Israel uniquely without justification → Consider context

3. **Is coded language present?**
   - "Rothschilds," "globalists," "cosmopolitans" in conspiratorial context → **ANTISEMITIC**
   - Technical financial/political terms → **NOT_ANTISEMITIC**
   - Ambiguous references → **UNCLEAR**

### Context Considerations
- **Speaker identity**: A Palestinian describing personal experience vs. others making same statements
- **Pattern over time**: Single statement vs. pattern of statements
- **Emotional context**: Reaction to specific events vs. general statements
- **Intent indicators**: Academic analysis vs. inflammatory rhetoric

## 5. Special Instructions

### Coded Language
Common antisemitic dog whistles include:
- "Globalists" or "cosmopolitans" (when implying Jewish conspiracy)
- "Cultural Marxists" (often coded reference to Jews)
- "(((Triple parentheses)))" around names
- References to "puppet masters" or "hidden hands"
- "Khazars" or "fake Jews" rhetoric

### Cultural and Regional Differences
- Consider that criticism styles vary across cultures
- Historical contexts (e.g., post-colonial perspectives) matter
- Academic discourse may use different standards than public discourse
- Religious criticism requires special sensitivity to distinguish from ethnic prejudice

## 6. Quality Checklist

Before finalizing your annotation, verify:
- [ ] Have you considered the full context available?
- [ ] Have you distinguished between criticism of Israel/Zionism and antisemitism?
- [ ] Have you checked for classical antisemitic tropes?
- [ ] Have you considered whether similar criticism would be applied to other states?
- [ ] Have you identified any coded language?
- [ ] Is your annotation consistent with the JDA definition?

## 7. Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Conflating all criticism of Israel with antisemitism** - Evidence-based criticism is protected political speech
2. **Missing coded antisemitism** - "Globalist" rhetoric often masks antisemitic conspiracy theories
3. **Ignoring context** - The same statement can have different meanings depending on speaker and situation
4. **Over-interpreting ambiguity** - When genuinely unclear, mark as UNCLEAR rather than guessing
5. **Applying different standards** - Use same criteria for Israel as for other states
6. **Confusing anti-Zionism with antisemitism** - Opposition to political ideology vs. hatred of Jews
7. **Missing Holocaust denial/distortion** - Even "subtle" questioning often indicates denialism

## 8. Final Reminders

- **The core definition is key**: Antisemitism targets Jews *as Jews*
- **Context matters significantly**: Consider speaker, audience, and broader discourse
- **Protect legitimate political speech**: Criticism, even harsh criticism, isn't automatically antisemitic
- **Recognize classical tropes**: Conspiracy theories, blood libel, and dual loyalty remain central to antisemitism
- **When uncertain, choose UNCLEAR**: Better to acknowledge ambiguity than make incorrect determinations
- **Apply consistent standards**: What's acceptable criticism of other states should be acceptable for Israel
- **Remember the dual purpose**: Fight antisemitism AND protect open political debate

The goal is to create accurate, consistent annotations that help identify genuine antisemitism while preserving space for legitimate political discourse and human rights advocacy.
