IHRA (International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance) working definition of antisemitism
</name>

<definition>
Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.
</defintion>

<guidelines>
To guide IHRA in its work, the following examples may serve as illustrations:

1. Manifestations might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity. However, criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic. Antisemitism frequently charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity, and it is often used to blame Jews for “why things go wrong.” It is expressed in speech, writing, visual forms and action, and employs sinister stereotypes and negative character traits.

2.0 Manifestations might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity. However,
criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic. Antisemitism
frequently charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity, and it is often used to blame Jews for “why things go
wrong.” It is expressed in speech, writing, visual forms and action, and employs sinister stereotypes and negative
character traits.
2.1 Contemporary examples of antisemitism in public life, the media, schools, the workplace, and in the religious sphere
could, taking into account the overall context, include, but are not limited to:
2.1.1 Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view
of religion.
2.1.2 Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of
Jews as collective — such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews
controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions.
2.1.3 Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish
person or group, or even for acts committed by non-Jews.
2.1.4 Denying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g. gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at
the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices during World War II (the Holocaust).
2.1.5 Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust.
2.1.6 Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the
interests of their own nations.
2.1.7 Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel
is a racist endeavor.
2.1.8 Applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.
2.1.9 Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel)
to characterize Israel or Israelis.
2.1.10 Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.
2.1.11 Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel.
3.0 Antisemitic acts are criminal when they are so defined by law (for example, denial of the Holocaust or distribution of antisemitic materials in some countries).

4.0 Criminal acts are antisemitic when the targets of attacks, whether they are
people or property – such as buildings, schools, places of worship and cemeteries – are selected because they are, or are
perceived to be, Jewish or linked to Jews.] 
5.0 Antisemitic discrimination is the denial to Jews of opportunities or
services available to others and is illegal in many countries.

<clarification>

The definition notes that non-Jewish individuals can also become victims of antisemitism. We infer from
guideline 4.0 that this is the case if they are perceived to be Jewish or linked to Jews. Additionally, we infer from guideline
2.1.2 that rhetoric can be antisemitic even if no specific Jewish individual or communal institution is targeted, but rather,
the target is an abstract Jewish collective.
guideline 2.1 lists 11 examples of contemporary forms of antisemitism. The IHRA has made it clear in additional statements that the examples are part of the definition.
The example of Holocaust denial (2.14) includes denying the scope and the intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people. Denying the scope of the Holocaust means denying that close to six million Jews were murdered for being Jews.
The IHRA also adopted a “Working Definition of Holocaust Denial and Distortion.” It is in accordance with its definition of antisemitism and further exemplifies that Holocaust denial “may include publicly denying or calling into doubt the use of principal mechanisms of destruction (such as gas chambers, mass shooting, starvation and torture)” and also “blaming
the Jews for either exaggerating or creating the Shoah for political or financial gain as if the Shoah itself was the result of a conspiracy plotted by the Jews.”
2.1.7 mentions denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination. Taking into account the next example, 2.1.8,
“Applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation” we
include the denial of Israel’s right to exist in its geographical region. However, the second part of 3.1.7, “claiming that
the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor” does not mean that all accusations of racism against Israel are
antisemitic. It means that claiming that a State of Israel as per se racist (or an Apartheid state) is an example of denying
the Jewish people their right to self-determination and is therefore antisemitic.
The Working Definition mentions “mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as
such” and “classic stereotypes” without listing them explicitly. Below you find a composite of allegations and
stereotypes that have become part of that repertoire. We compiled them by looking at descriptions that other scholars
have identified as prominent antisemitic stereotypes in the past 2000 years.
Antisemitic allegations and stereotypes can be made by characterizing “the Jews” or by ascribing certain physical traits
to them. Accusations of wrongdoing on the part of Jews also form part of the rich history of antisemitic stereotypes, as
well as certain tropes. They can also be shown in the demonization of things and individuals that are thought of as being
representative of Jews or Jewish beliefs. Certain beliefs, usually religious in nature, advocate for the punishment of Jews
and also belong to the antisemitic tradition. Endorsing Nazism, Holocaust denial, or Israel-related forms of antisemitism
are newer phenomena that are addressed explicitly and with examples in the working definition.


Supposed “ Jewish character ” is portrayed as stingy; greedy; immensely rich; being good with money; exploitative;
corrupt; amoral; perverted; ruthless; cruel; heartless; anti-national/cosmopolitan; treacherous; disloyal; fraudulent;

octopi; snakes; rats; germs; and blood sucking entities.

Freemasons, Illuminati, Jewish lobby, Zionist Lobby, Zionist Neocons, ZOG (Zionist Occupied Government); waging a
(proxy) war against Islam/ Christianity; luring Christians/ Muslims away from Christianity/ Islam; profanation of Christian
symbols; host desecration; practicing witchcraft; usury; profiteering; exploiting non-Jews; running transnational,
allegedly “Jewish companies” in the interest of the Jews such as McDonalds, Starbucks, Coca Cola, Facebook; using
blood from non-Jews for ritual purposes; killing or mutilating children for ritual purposes; adoring false gods and idols,
such as the Golden Calf and Moloch; rejecting truth and being blind to the truth; perverting scripture; sticking to the

material gain; being responsible for Christianity and the power of the church, for oligarchies, financial speculation,
exploitation, capitalism, modernity, communism, bolshevism, liberalism, democracy, urbanization, Americanization, and
globalization.
Demonization of things associated with Jews or of individuals seen as representative of Jews include the demonization
of synagogues, Judaism, the Talmud, Kabbalah; the Judaization of enemies (using “Jew” as an insult); and the
demonization of prominent Jews, such George Soros, Ariel Sharon, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Abraham Foxman as Jews.
Nonvisual memes or recurrent phraseology that are part of an antisemitic repertoire in different historical and cultural
contexts include “Jews are the children/ spawn of Satan; synagogue of Satan; God has (eternally) cursed the Jews;
Judaism (Jewish alleged choseness) is racist; Jews don’t have a home country and cannot be a nation; Jews have no
culture; Crypto Jews (converted Jews or their offspring remain Jewish and secretly act in the ‘Jewish interest’); ‘Jewish
spirit’ in science, music, culture is harmful to non-Jews; use of the terms ‘Jewish terror’ or ‘Zydokumuna’ for purges
under communism; Jewish soldiers in WW1/ WW2 were traitors; all pro-Jewish or pro-Israeli organizations are funded/
operated by the Mossad; Jews are descendants of monkeys and pigs; Jews should never be taken as friends; Jews are
the eternal enemies of Islam and Muslims. Muslims will kill the Jews at the end of time; reference to the battle of
Khaybar; synagogues should be set on fire; Jews killed or sold out their own prophets/the son of God; Jews try to evade
taxes/ Jews don’t pay taxes; Hitler let some Jews live so that the world would know why he exterminated Jews;
‘International Zionism’ prevents a critical discussion about the Holocaust.”
Calls for punishment or justification of Jewish suffering have also been part of an antisemitic discourse, mostly in
religious contexts, such as “Jewish suffering is punishment by God; Humiliation and misery of Jews is proof of the truth
of Christianity/Islam. Misery of Jews is proof of truth of Christianity.; Jews should be burnt as a form of punishment;
Persecution of Jews under Hitler was punishment by God."
Holocaust denial is described in the IHRA Definition of Antisemitism. The more detailed IHRA Working Definition of
Holocaust Denial and Distortion is used as additional guidance.
Endorsing Nazism today means endorsing the systematic killings of Jews by the Nazis (and their helpers). It i s often done
by the affirmative use of pro-Nazi memes and symbols.
Manifestations of antisemitism related to Israel are described in the Working Definition, including examples.
Additional, frequently used antisemitic concepts include "Jews crucify or ritually kill Palestinians" and the use of terms
such as "Zionist Entity" to describe the State of Israel, which is a refusal to acknowledge the existence of Israel and thus
a form of denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination. The following claims are “comparisons of
contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis” (example 3.1.10 in the working definition): equating Israeli politicians
with Nazi leaders, such as Netanyahu = Hitler; claims that Israel engages in genocide/ “a Holocaust” against the
Palestinian people; claims that the situation in the Gaza Strip is similar to the situation in the Warsaw Ghetto; using Nazi
vocabulary to describe and denounce actions by the Israeli state, such as claims that Israel wages a war of extermination
against the Palestinians.
Most symbols that have an antisemitic connotation are positive references to Nazism or to the Holocaust, such as the
swastika or other Nazi or Nazi-predecessor flags, the Hitler salute, emblems of Nazi organizations such as the SS, Nazi
slogans such as “Blut und Ehre” (blood and honor), or numbers representing “Heil Hitler” (88), “Adolf Hitler” (18).
Positive references to the Holocaust used to manifest endorsement for the killing of J ews include symbols representing
Zyklon B gas, including hissing noises, or references to ovens that were used to burn the people who were gassed
(including pictures taken from these ovens).
The ADL Hate Symbols Database provides an extensive list of symbols used by hate groups, mostly white supremacists
and Neo-Nazis.^4 This list helps us to contextualize tweets. We consider all symbols with positive references to Nazism
antisemitic because they implicitly endorse the murder of Jews. Symbols by extremist Christian and Muslim groups are
not as extensively documented (Ostovar 2017).^5 Some Jihadist groups, such as Hamas or Houthi,^6 are known for their
antisemitism and lethally targeting victims as Jews. Endorsing the aforementioned groups is treated as a context
suggesting antisemitism, but is annotated as antisemitic only when there are other references in the tweets to Jews,
Judaism, or Israel that make an antisemitic reading of it likely.
