# IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism (2016)

## Background
- Adopted by the **International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA)** Plenary in Bucharest on **26 May 2016**.  
- Intended as a **non-legally binding working definition** to guide IHRA in its work.  
- Inspired by the **Stockholm Declaration**, recognizing the responsibility to combat antisemitism and xenophobia.

## Core Definition
**“Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews.  
Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.”**

---

## General Principles
- Antisemitism often involves **charges of conspiracy** and blaming Jews for “why things go wrong.”  
- It can be expressed in **speech, writing, images, or actions**, and makes use of **sinister stereotypes and negative character traits**.  
- Manifestations might include **targeting Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity**.  
- **Criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country is not antisemitic.**

6. **Dual loyalty**  
   - “Jewish citizens are more loyal to Israel than to our country.”  

7. **Denial of Jewish self-determination**  
   - Claiming that the existence of Israel as a Jewish state is inherently racist.

- **Antisemitic discrimination** is denial to Jews of services or opportunities available to others.
